You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Building and Testing

AndroidX Test uses the [bazel](https://bazel.build) build system.

Currently only Linux is fully supported. For Mac and windows users, you may be able to build 
and run the Robolectric tests.

### One time setup

*   [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
    [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the
    [AndroidX Test repo](https://github.com/android/android-test)
*   Install [bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).
    Version 2.2.0 is recommended. For instrumentation testing on Linux make sure your environment 
    meets the following
    [prerequisites](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/android-instrumentation-test.html#prerequisites)
*   Install [maven](http://maven.apache.org/install.html) and make it available
    on PATH.
*   Install the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and
    run the following command to ensure you have the necessary components:
    `./tools/bin/sdkmanager --install 'build-tools;30.0.2'
    'platforms;android-30' 'emulator' 'platform-tools'
    'system-images;android-19;default;x86'
    'system-images;android-21;default;x86'
    'system-images;android-22;default;x86'
    'system-images;android-23;default;x86'`
*   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to the SDK install
    location. For example
    *   On Linux: export ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android/Sdk
    *   On Mac: export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk
    You can also add this command to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.profile file to make it 
    permanent.

### IDE setup

Android Studio is recommended.

*   Install the [Bazel Android Studio plugin](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/ide.html).
*   Setup Bazel Android Studio plugin:
    *   Navigate to `Settings > Other Settings > Bazel Settings`
    *   Update `Bazel binary location` to `/path/to/bazel/binary` (on Mac it's usually 
      `/usr/local/bin/bazel`)
*   Select 'Import Bazel project' and set workspace location to android-test
    github repo
*   Select 'Import project view' and select <github repo>/.bazelproject

Check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for tips on resolving common build issues.

### Building

```
bazel build <target path>
```

For example, to build the AndroidX Test maven repository:
```
bazel build :axt_m2repository
```

### Testing

```
bazel test <target path> --spawn_strategy=local
```

eg to run the androidx-test-core tests
```
bazel test //core/javatests/â€¦ --spawn_strategy=local
```

To run all the robolectric local tests (and thus replicate the Google Cloud
Build CI) `bazel test ... --test_tag_filters=robolectric
--build_tag_filters=robolectric`

### Troubleshooting

#### Unresolved imports after build

If your project fails to build because of unresolved imports two things might be wrong.

1. Missing Android SDK components.
   Open SDK Manager in Android Studio and check that the platform and build tools versions specified in the `WORKSPACE` file are installed.
   Look at the following variables:

    ```bazel
    android_sdk_repository(
        ...
        api_level = 30,
        build_tools_version = "30.0.2",
        ...
    )
    ```

2. Something might be wrong with `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable setup. Try adding the path of 
the android-sdk to the `WORKSPACE` file:

    ```bazel
    android_sdk_repository(
        ...
        path = "/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk",
        ...
    )
    ```
