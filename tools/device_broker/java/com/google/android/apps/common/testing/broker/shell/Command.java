/**
 * <p>Represents an executable command, including its arguments and
 * runtime environment (environment variables, working directory). This class
 * lets a caller execute a command, get its results, and optionally try to kill
 * the task during execution.</p>
 *
 * <p>The use of "shell" in the full name of this class is a misnomer.  In
 * terms of the way its arguments are interpreted, this class is closer to
 * {@code execve(2)} than to {@code system(3)}.  No Bourne shell is executed.
 *
 * <p>The most basic use-case for this class is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *   String[] args = { "/bin/du", "-s", directory };
 *   CommandResult result = new Command(args).execute();
 *   String output = new String(result.getStdout());
 * </pre>
 * which writes the output of the {@code du(1)} command into {@code output}.
 * More complex cases might inspect the stderr stream, kill the subprocess
 * asynchronously, feed input to its standard input, handle the exceptions
 * thrown if the command fails, or print the termination status (exit code or
 * signal name).
 *
 * <h4>Invoking the Bourne shell</h4>
 *
 * <p>Perhaps the most common command invoked programmatically is the UNIX
 * shell, {@code /bin/sh}.  Because the shell is a general-purpose programming
 * language, care must be taken to ensure that variable parts of the shell
 * command (e.g. strings entered by the user) do not contain shell
 * metacharacters, as this poses a correctness and/or security risk.
 *
 * <p>To execute a shell command directly, use the following pattern:
 * <pre>
 *   String[] args = { "/bin/sh", "-c", shellCommand };
 *   CommandResult result = new Command(args).execute();
 * </pre>
 * {@code shellCommand} is a complete Bourne shell program, possibly containing
 * all kinds of unescaped metacharacters.  For example, here's a shell command
 * that enumerates the working directories of all processes named "foo":
 * <pre>ps auxx | grep foo | awk '{print $1}' |
 *      while read pid; do readlink /proc/$pid/cwd; done</pre>
 * It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that this string means what
 * they intend.
 *
 * <p>Consider the risk posed by allowing the "foo" part of the previous
 * command to be some arbitrary (untrusted) string called {@code processName}:
 * <pre>
 *  // WARNING: unsafe!
 *  String shellCommand = "ps auxx | grep " + processName + " | awk '{print $1}' | "
 *  + "while read pid; do readlink /proc/$pid/cwd; done";</pre>
 * </pre>
 * Passing this string to {@link Command} is unsafe because if the string
 * {@processName} contains shell metacharacters, the meaning of the command can
 * be arbitrarily changed;  consider:
 * <pre>String processName = ". ; rm -fr $HOME & ";</pre>
 *
 * <p>To defend against this possibility, it is essential to properly quote the
 * variable portions of the shell command so that shell metacharacters are
 * escaped.  Use {@link ShellUtils#shellEscape} for this purpose:
 * <pre>
 *  // Safe.
 *  String shellCommand = "ps auxx | grep " + ShellUtils.shellEscape(processName)
 *      + " | awk '{print $1}' | while read pid; do readlink /proc/$pid/cwd; done";
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Tip: if you are only invoking a single known command, and no shell
 * features (e.g. $PATH lookup, output redirection, pipelines, etc) are needed,
 * call it directly without using a shell, as in the {@code du(1)} example
 * above.
 *
 * <h4>Other features</h4>
 *
 * <p>A caller can optionally specify bytes to be written to the process's
 * "stdin". The returned {@link CommandResult} object gives the caller access to
 * the exit status, as well as output from "stdout" and "stderr". To use
 * this class with processes that generate very large amounts of input/output,
 * consider
 * {@link #execute(InputStream, KillableObserver, OutputStream, OutputStream)}
 * and
 * {@link #execute(byte[], KillableObserver, OutputStream, OutputStream)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This class ensures that stdout and stderr streams are read promptly,
 * avoiding potential deadlock if the output is large. See <a
 * href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1229-traps.html"> When
 * <code>Runtime.exec()</code> won't</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is immutable and therefore thread-safe.</p>
